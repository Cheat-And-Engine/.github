## What is Cheat Engine?

**Cheat Engine** is a powerful, open-source memory scanning and debugging tool designed primarily for Windows. It enables users to modify various aspects of single-player video games, such as health, ammo, score, and other in-game values. By scanning and altering a game's memory in real-time, Cheat Engine provides deep insight into how games store and manage data.

While often used for creating cheats or trainers, Cheat Engine is also a valuable tool for developers, reverse engineers, and curious gamers who want to understand game mechanics. It supports advanced features like speed hacking, disassembly, and Lua scripting, allowing for extensive customization and automation.

Cheat Engine is widely used in games like **The Witcher 3**, **Skyrim**, and **Grand Theft Auto V**, and is trusted by millions for its reliability and versatility. Whether you're learning about memory editing, testing game modifications, or simply having fun in single-player modes, Cheat Engine offers a robust and free platform for all your needs.
